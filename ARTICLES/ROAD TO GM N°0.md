Today's date is Monday, the twenty-third of December. In just 3 days, I will be competing in a chess tournament in Auxerre, France.

Today is a great day to set a goal that I have had in mind for a very long time. I want to become a chess Grandmaster. My current classical rating is 1900 FIDE (but I must say that I am currently 1913 live, thanks to a draw against a 2300 IM and another against a 1800). So, doing the math, we can see that I need another whopping 600 points to achieve the title.

I have been playing chess online for almost 3 years now online, and now I can see that my progress was pretty slow. I started with a 600 rating in January 2022 and today I am 'only' 2200 (but with a peak of 2360 in October).

So today, I am setting the goal of becoming a chess Grandmaster. I won't set any time limit for it, or any constraint whatsoever. I just wanted to write in down on paper, here on my blog.

I will write articles here each Monday (but I might change that if I'm playing in a tournament). You will find on my blog various articles of different size, I will mostly share my training routine and reflect on my tournaments, but I will also review chess books and courses and other random subjects.

Thank you for your attention. Have a nice day !
